                    <p>Modern aircraft are highly sought after for many reasons, including their safety, modernity, and
                        hightech features.
                        They range from $100,000-$10 million dollars depending on the age, condition and model. Since
                        many flight centers
                        cannot immediately afford to purchase aircraft with increasing
                        demand in their business and general aviation, they are looking for modern aircraft owners to
                        lease from.</p>

                    <p>The main risk as an aircraft owner is unplanned maintenance.
                        Due to the nature of maintaining an aircraft it is possible to lose some money on each
                        investment at some point.</p>

                    <p>AeroPups is a lifelong project so future proofing is essential.
                        Diversifying and growing the aircraft fleet will ensure stability within the project.
                        The mission is to purchase newer aircraft with fewer maintenance needs. Every aircraft purchased
                        will have a thorough pre-purchase inspection;
                        the team has 12 years of flying experience which ensures the best decisions possible will be made when evaluating an aircraft.</p>

                        Every holder will receive AeroDrops, meaning surprises often! We will also invite as many
                        holders as possible to fly with us if they’re up for an adventure! We are committed to
                        working on this project forever; it’s our hope that our community will want to pass the
                        AeroPups to the next generation of collectors.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the initial 10,000 NFT launch, we will allocate a large portion of revenue to expansion.
                        Through this we can grow our fleet, thus increasing the revenue and scalability of the company.
                        We will plan to launch a V2 and V3 in 2023/2024 when expanding into larger charter aircraft to diversify our fleet.
                        The NFT art is also very important to us; NFTs started as art and collectables,
                        and we want to carry on the tradition to bring massive value to our holders forever.</p>
